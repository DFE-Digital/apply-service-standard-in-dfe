# Contributing to the Apply the Service Standard in DfE manual

We want your input! We want to make contributing to this manual as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug or issue
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new content
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the code (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

Clone or Fork the repo (Fork it if you don't have write access)

Before you do anything, create a new branch for your changes - Run:

``` 
git branch name-of-your-branch 
``` 

for example: 

``` 
git branch accessibility-content 
```

Checkout the branch - Run: 

```
git checkout name-of-your-branch 
``` 

for example: 

``` 
git checkout accessibility-content 
```

Make your suggested changes

Check your code and validate all links, test it properly

When ready to commit stage the changes and add a useful comment for the commit - Run:

```
git add . 
git commit -m "Comments for the change" 
```

Switch back to the main branch - Run:

```
git checkout main 
```

Push the change up to GitHub into your new branch named in step 3 - Run: 

```
git push origin name-of-your-branch 
``` 

for example: 

``` 
git push origin accessibility-content 
``` 

You should see something like:

``` 
remote: Create a pull request for 'my-improvements' on GitHub by visiting: 
remote:  https://github.com/your_username/project_name_here/pull/new/my-improvements 
```

Copy or click the URL and complete the pull request for the change on GitHub. 

Save the pull request on GitHub and we will review it and accept and merge or reject the change. 

!! Do not make changes in the gh_pages branch
