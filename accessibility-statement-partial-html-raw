&lt;h4&gt;Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations&lt;/h4&gt;

&gt; **Guidance notes:** List using non-technical language, as far as possible, how the content is not accessible, including reference(s) to the applicable requirements in the relevant standards and/or technical specifications that are not met. For example:
&gt;
&gt; - Some images don&#39;t contain alternative text to describe the image which does not meet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopner noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Web Content Accessibility Guidelines&quot;&gt;WCAG&lt;/abbr&gt;  version 2.1 AA - 1.1.1 Non-text Content&lt;/a&gt;

&gt; **Guidance notes:** List non-accessible section(s)/content/function(s) for which the disproportionate burden exemption, within the meaning of the accessibility regulations is being temporarily invoked
&gt;
&gt; - Making improvements would exceed budget for the year and leave the department unable to do other work - and would not significantly improve things for disabled users.

&lt;h4&gt;The content is not within the scope of the accessibility regulations&lt;/h4&gt;

&gt; **Guidance notes:** List non-accessible content which is out of scope of the accessibility regulations, for example:
