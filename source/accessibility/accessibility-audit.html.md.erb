# Accessibility audit and testing

Service teams must arrange for an accessibility audit to be carried out before they move to public beta. This is to ensure the service is compliant with the accessibility regulations. This audit should be repeated every 12 months or if there are significant changes to a service.

You should include budget for accessibility testing as part of your business case. External audits can cost a minimum of Â£4,000 to carry out. 

## Internal testing and audits

You should be carrying out testing within the team on your service to make sure it's meeting the minimum accessibility requirements. 

Some teams will have testers and team members that can test and audit services to WCAG 2.1 AA standard. However, there are a range of tools and services available to carry out basic testing yourself.

### Testing

Most tools will run in the browser or can be added as browser extentions to Edge or Chrome.

### Internal audit

If you don't have people in your team who can do this, you can request an internal audit.

If your service is currently being service managed within Digital Data and Technology (DDaT) and it appears on the internal Configuration Management Database (CMDB), then the Business Engagement and Accessibility Team can undertake an assurance audit for you. If you are unsure, <a href="mailto:accessibility.support@education.gov.uk">contact the accessibility support team</a>.

Otherwise, you will need to find an external supplier to carry out an audit.

## External audit

An external audit will be more comprehensive and include users with accessibility needs. It will also take longer to complete as you will need to allow for the time for procurement plus agencies rarely will have immediate availability.  Allow 1-3 months for the audit to be arranged and carried out.

Contact the [Digital and Technologies Contracts](Dandt.CONTRACTS@education.gov.uk) team. They might have an existing contract in place that can be used for an audit or they can help you to procure a supplier through the <a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/" >Digital Marketplace</a>.
