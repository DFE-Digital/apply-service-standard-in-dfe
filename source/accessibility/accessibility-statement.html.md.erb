# Accessibility statement


> All websites published after 23 September 2018 being used by end users (internal DfE staff or external users), must be fully accessible.

A link to the statement should be easy to find on the website and service homepage, or made available on every web page, for example, in the footer links. 

For mobile apps, the statement should be available on the website of the public sector body that developed the app, or with other information available when downloading the app. The statement can also be made available from within the app.

## Statement templates

The following statements are designed to make it easier to create the correct statement for your service, and it's level of compliance to WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

### Guidance on disproportionate burden 

You might judge that the benefits of making some things accessible would not justify the cost to DfE to resolve. In that case, you can claim it would not be reasonable for you to make those things accessible because it’s a disproportionate burden.

You cannot take things like lack of time or knowledge into account in your assessment - or argue that making things accessible is a disproportionate burden because you’ve not given it priority.
