## What a service assessment is

A service assessment is a peer review of a transactional service to check it meets the 14 points of the Service Standard.

A transactional service is any service which allows users to:

- create or update information stored by government
- exchange money, goods and services
- make a request

Examples include: converting to an academy, buying equipment for schools or recruiting an apprentice.
