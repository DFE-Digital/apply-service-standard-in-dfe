# 1. Understand users and their needs

<%= banner_panel("You'll be assessed on this","You'll be assessed on what you've done to meet this Service Standard point at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>.")%>

This guidance will help you apply  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-1-understand-user-needs" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">standard point 1 understand users and their needs (opens in new tab)</a>.

Take time to understand users' needs and the problem you're trying to solve for them.

Think about people's entire experience and the systems and processes around the product or service you're building.

## Why it's important

You need to understand your users and their needs to build something that helps them. Otherwise you could build the wrong thing or make DfE services more difficult to use.

Understanding as much of the context as possible will give you the best chance of meeting users' needs in the most simple, cost effective way.

The most obvious problem is not always the one that needs solving. Test assumptions early and often to reduce the risk of building the wrong thing.

This standard may not be applicable if what you are building:

- does not have identifiable user needs but is delivering a DfE policy intent, or

- prioritises business requirements over user needs

If this is the case, you may need to consider whether or not you go through a service assessment. Other standards may still be applicable to your service, for example <a href='/service-standard/5-make-sure-everyone-can-use-the-service.html'>point 5 make sure everyone can use the service</a>. 


## How to meet this standard at each phase

It's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed.

### At discovery

Assessors will look for:

- an understanding of the types and numbers of users who might use the service
- how the team articulate the problem to be solved
- how the team have involved and considered users with access needs
- demonstration of why the team selected the research methods they used
- well scoped research questions
- a variety of methods of user research
- a prioritised list of user needs
- a prioritised list of user stories, including security anti-personas if relevant
- an understanding of the difference between users and stakeholders
- a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) has been started, where neccessary
- a plan for alpha

<%# <%= do_dont_list(["a good understanding of the types and numbers of users who might use the service", 
"how the team have involved and considered users with access needs",

"a plan for alpha"], "Assessors will look for", "do") %> 

<%= do_dont_list(["user needs that describe solutions or business requirements", "user needs that confuse needs with desires"], "Things to avoid", "dont") %>
 
### At alpha

Assessors will look for:

- collaboration with other service-related teams and stakeholders, including policy 
- use of existing research and performance data across DfE
- clear definition of user needs
- clear definition of user groups
- how <a href="https://design.education.gov.uk/inclusive-design.html" target="_blank">inclusive design (opens in new tab)</a> is being considered in addition to testing with people with access needs
- an [accessibility audit](/accessibility/accessibility-audit.html) plan
- hypotheses related to user needs
- hypotheses tested with a variety of quick, throwaway prototypes
- research that identifies parts of the service which users find difficult
- evidence of how the team iterated the service to make these parts easier for users and how this was tested and researched 
- concepts being tested and validated with users with access needs
- an understanding of the tools and technology users have access to
- a plan for private beta, including the eligibility criteria for real user participation and methods of measuring their experience  
- research and thought into how the service will be maintained and supported
- thinking about how the service might need to scale in the future

<%= do_dont_list(["research findings that are about user preferences rather than user behaviour",
"a lack of different ways of testing solutions",
"not testing with users with access needs"], "Things to avoid", "dont") %>


### At beta 

Assessors will look for:

- recommendations from alpha assessment have been addressed
- a plan for ongoing research and continuous improvement
- choosing the best methods to get results and feedback for the problems identified, not just relying on usability testing
- user research working with performance analysis to define success metrics
- how design and user needs have changed over time based on user research
- assisted digital routes have been tested
- a third party accessibility audit of the service and actions taken based on findings
- a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) has been carried out, where neccessary
- any neccessary security testing

<%= do_dont_list(["not testing all service touch points","
not doing usability testing with users with access needs, separate from an audit"], "Things to avoid", "dont") %>


### At live

Assessors will look for:

- recommendations from beta assessment have been addressed
- user research working with performance analysis to define success metrics
- a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) has been carried out, where neccessary
- a third party accessibility audit of the service and actions taken based on findings
- any neccessary security testing
- what the team has done beyond public beta to meet user needs and deliver outcomes

Each DDaT profession in DfE has their own community and guidance.
