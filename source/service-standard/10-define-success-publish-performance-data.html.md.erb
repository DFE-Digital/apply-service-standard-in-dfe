Work out what success looks like for your DfE service. Collect performance information across all channels so that you can measure and show that the service is effective and improving.

## Why it's important 

You’ll be assessed on what you’ve done to meet this service standard point at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>.

Having clear objectives, a definition of what success looks like and appropriate metrics means that you'll know whether the service is solving the problem it's meant to solve.

Collecting the right information will alert you to improvements you need to make and help you know if changes have the effect you intend.

Services funded by public money should be transparent about how they are performing.

## How to meet this standard at each phase

It's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed.

### At alpha

Things to consider:

- Definition of the things you want to measure and why and how these measurements will be obtained. Potential options for collecting this data could include:

  - analytics which describe time spent on pages, heatmaps, if users start something but don't finish it
 - performance data and reporting to capture baseline measurements on service efficiency, timescales, service level agreements (SLAs)
 - qualitative data, which could include anecdotal evidence or feedback from users on the current as-is service captured via user research
- evidence of finding baseline data
- evidence of how the team have iterated and improved metrics and data collection practices as you learn more about user needs
- what metrics support strategy, to improve, rather than just maintain the service

<%= do_dont_list(["putting measurements against data that doesn't currently exist in the as-is. However, you may wish to explain the reasons that certain measurements could not be included when describing the measurement choices you have selected."], "Things to avoid at alpha", "dont") %>

### At beta

Things to consider:

- measurement data agreed in the KPIs during alpha has been captured and collated
- quantitative and qualitative data has been combined to create realisation of benefits 
- demonstration of how the collated data provides evidence to show how the new service is improving experience and performance for users
- evidence of performance data being used to make decisions about how to fix problems and improve the service
- engagement with business owners and stakeholders to help to make decisions using performance data 
- ways to collect metrics and data are iterated and improved as the team learns more about user needs

### At live

Things to consider:

- regularly published performance metrics for the service
- learnings from metrics in beta
