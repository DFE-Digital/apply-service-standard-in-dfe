Service teams will need to work out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success" target="_blank">what success looks like (opens in new tab)</a> for their DfE service. Collect performance information across all online and offline channels so that you can measure and show that the service is effective and improving.

## Why it's important 

Having clear objectives, a definition of what success looks like and appropriate metrics can help you know whether the service is solving the problem it's meant to solve.

Collecting the right information and interpreting it will alert you to potential improvements you need to make and help you know if changes have the effect you intend.

## How to meet this standard in each phase

You'll be assessed on what you've done to meet this standard at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>. However, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed, it's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard point.

### In alpha

#### Things to consider:

- define what you want to measure and why and how these measurements will be obtained. Potential options for collecting this data could include:

  - analytics which describe time spent on pages, heatmaps, if users start something but don't finish it
 - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/using-data-to-improve-your-service-an-introduction" target="_blank">performance data (opens in new tab)</a> and reporting, to capture baseline measurements on service efficiency, timescales, service level agreements (SLAs)
 - qualitative data, which could include insights from users on the current as-is service captured via user research and feedback
- evidence of finding baseline data, or why this is not available, with a plan to show how you will measure future success 
- evidence of how the team have iterated and improved metrics and data collection plans as you learn more about user needs
- what metrics could you analyse to support or improve the service

<%= do_dont_list(["putting measurements against data that doesn't currently exist in the as-is service. However, you may wish to explain the reasons that certain measurements could not be included when describing the measurement choices you have selected."], "Things to avoid at alpha", "dont") %>

### In beta and live

#### Things to consider:

- measurement data agreed in the KPIs during alpha has been captured and collated
- quantitative and qualitative data has been combined to measure where the benefits are being realised
- demonstration of how the collated data provides evidence to show how the new service is performing for users
- evidence of performance data being used to make decisions about how to fix problems and improve the service
- engagement with business owners and stakeholders to help to make decisions using performance data 
- ways to collect metrics and data are iterated and improved as the team learns more about user needs
- regularly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/data-you-must-publish" target="_blank">publishing performance metrics (opens in new tab)</a>, these must include cost per transaction, user satisfaction, completion rate and digital take-up
- when moving to live, learnings from metrics in beta are applied
