Use open standards, common components and patterns, and create new ones if there is not one that already meets your needs.

## Why it's important 

Using common components and patterns means you do not have to solve problems that have already been solved. By using a component or pattern that's already been assured and extensively tested, you can provide users with a good experience in a cost effective way. It also speeds up delivery and reduces risk.

We encourage teams to develop components and patterns that meet a shared need, it's important to share them so that others can benefit from your work.

## How to meet this standard throughout the delivery lifecycle

You'll be assessed on what you've done to meet this standard at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>. However, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed, it's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard point.

<%= example_panel("DfE assessor tips","<p><b>Prompts to help services and products meet this standard </b><p>
<p>Have your choices of open standards and coding standards changed? If so, can you explain why?</p>
<p>Can you justify any decision to generate new common components or patterns for reuse?</p>
<p>How will the team ensure that ongoing significant changes are assured by architecture and security teams?</p>")%>

Things to consider:

- teams have reached out to other teams to learn from their experience
- teams have researched other similar services and considered possible patterns, <a href='https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/common-components/#common-components'target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">components (opens in new tab)</a> and tools 
- open-source tools and frameworks have been chosen or considered as the basis for the service components
- evidence of a <a href="https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/" target="_blank">design history (opens in new tab)</a> to keep track of design decisions, options explored and rationale for choices made 
- recording <a href="https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/standards/architecture-documentation/#architecture-documentation" target="_blank">architecture decisions (opens in new tab)</a> to track decisions and rationale
- how to share and encourage use of new and existing patterns within the wider DfE service community

## How to apply this standard in your role

Each DDaT profession in DfE has their own community and guidance.
