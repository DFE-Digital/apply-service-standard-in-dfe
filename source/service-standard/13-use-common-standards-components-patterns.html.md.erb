Use open standards, common components and patterns, and create new ones if there is not one that already meets your needs.

## Why it's important 

<%= example_panel("Assurance","<p>You’ll be assessed on what you’ve done to meet this Service Standard point at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>.</p>")%>


Using common components and patterns means you do not have to solve problems that have already been solved. By using a component or pattern that’s already been assured and extensively tested, you can provide users with a good experience in a cost effective way. It also speeds up delivery and reduces risk.

We encourage teams to develop components and patterns that meet a shared need, it’s important to share them so that others can benefit from your work.

## How to meet this standard throughout the delivery lifecycle

It's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed.

Assessors will look for:

- teams have reached out to other teams to learn from their experience
- teams have researched other similar services and considered possible patterns, components and tools 
- open-source tools and frameworks have been chosen or considered as the basis for the service components
- evidence of a <a href="https://design.education.gov.uk/design-assurance/design-histories.html" target="_blank">design history</a> to keep track of design decisions, options explored and rationale for choices made 
- evidence the team have considered ways to share and encourage use of new and existing patterns within the wider DfE service community

## How to apply this standard in your role

Each DDaT profession in DfE has their own community and guidance.
