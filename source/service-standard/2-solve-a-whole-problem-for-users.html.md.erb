# 2. Solve a whole problem for users

This guidance will help you apply  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-2-solve-a-whole-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">Service Standard point 2 (opens in new tab)</a>. You will be checked on how you meet this at a [service assessment](/service-assessments.html).

Consider where your service fits into your users' journey and whether you can solve a whole problem or influence a wider solution.  

Collaborate across teams, programmes and organisational boundaries to create a service that meets users' needs across all channels. Work to understand any constraints that affect the end-to-end service journey, for example, if users have to come in and then out of the service again to reach their end goal, what would that look like.

## Why it's important 

People often do not know how education services fit together. It helps if you can bring things together into a journey which makes sense to users, irrespective of which organisation they belong to or channel they use.

You may not be able to fix a whole problem, but you may be able to improve it and support or influence a wider solution.

## How to meet this standard at each phase

It's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed.

### At discovery 

**Things to consider:**

- understand where the service touches other services and speak to those teams 
- explore where the service should start and stop 
- show how design, user research and content design are considering the full end-to-end service, including the non-digital parts
- start to explore how to address any problems with internal processes, policy or legislation that make it difficult to join things up and address a whole problem
- how the team will talk through an end-to-end journey

**Things to avoid:**

- designing solutions or building a service
- ending the service at the end of an application, for example, not when the user has achieved their goal

### At alpha

**Things to consider:**

- demonstrate an understanding of where the service touches other services and speak to those teams 
- show how design, user research and content design are considering the full end to end service, including the non-digital parts
- explore where the service should start and stop
- understand the context and whole problem that the alpha is helping to solve
- map the current user journey, pain points and what the user journey will look like  
- demonstrate how to make it easy for users to focus on the next step in a journey, to help them achieve their goal
- how the team will talk through an end-to-end journey at a service assessment

**Things to avoid:**

- designing a digital version of a paper process
- ending the service at the end of an application, for example, not when the user has achieved their goal
- private beta plan being too ambitious or large. The team won't be able to iterate the service if it is for too many users 

### At beta and live

**Things to consider:**

- evidence from research and private beta analytics to show the service works and users can get through the end-to-end journey unaided
- design and test offline processes and user support, including assisted digital channels
- collaborate with teams that make part of the end-to-end service
- understand and research the full end-to-end journey, including online and offline journeys and GOV.UK content
- show how support, including assisted digital channels, are working
