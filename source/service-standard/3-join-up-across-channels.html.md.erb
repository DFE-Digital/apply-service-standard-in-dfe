Consider where your service fits into a wider journey or alongside other DfE services, and how it will join up across channels. 

This involves understanding how the online and offline parts of your service link together and any pain points users experience as a result of this.

## Why it's important 

You'll be assessed on what you've done to meet this service standard point at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>.

If a service moves between channels, for example, email, contact centres, paper forms or in person, and you bring those different channels together, you can design an experience that reduces friction for users. 

Understanding where your user needs fit into wider journeys can help to solve a whole problem for users.

## How to meet this standard at each phase

It's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed.

<%= example_panel("Think about","<p>If you are providing a service for a specific group of users, can you use learnings from existing research with that group of users?</p>
<p>Have you spoken with teams that work in the offline parts of the service, such as a call centre, and considered how an online service will affect them?</p>
<p>How will you consider all parts of the user journey and how will the team design a joined-up experience between online and offline parts of the service?</p>")%>

### At discovery

Things to consider:

- any channels that might be impacted by the policy intent or user needs
- what you might want to prototype and test at alpha
- use of existing research and performance data across DfE
- service and user journey mapping

<%= do_dont_list(["focusing on one aspect of the journey only", "not including other channels"], "Things to avoid at discovery", "dont") %>

### At alpha

Things to consider:

- data and research being used to improve offline and online channels
- how you've explored where the service should start and stop 
- use of common components, such as <a href="https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/common-components/#dfe-sign-in" target="_blank">DfE Sign-in</a>, to provide a consistent experience with other DfE services
- research with internal DfE teams who form part of the design of the service
- entry points to the service. For example, how users find or know about it
- gaps, drop off points, re-entry loops, transitions to other channels and returns to the service
- how design, user research and content design are considering the full end-to-end service, including the non-digital parts

<%= do_dont_list(["A service being built which is a live service. In alpha, you wouldn't be building a live service you would be testing prototypes"], "Things to avoid at alpha", "dont") %>



### At beta

Things to consider:

- use of <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">GOV.UK Design System (opens in new tab)</a> and patterns or testing new patterns where needed
- the right artefacts to describe the end-to-end service are being iterated and changed based on user research. For example service flows, blueprints, service maps
- how users will find the service and entry points
- a plan for how to onboard users to the service
- the team observing and getting feedback on the end-to-end journey
- performance data monitoring of drop out points
- offline processes and user support, including <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2011/07/28/an-introduction-to-assisted-digital/" target="_blank">assisted digital (opens in new tab)</a> routes, have been designed and tested, especially during public beta

<%= do_dont_list(["the scope for private beta being too large. If the scope is too large the service can actually becme a version of the live service.the team will not be able to spend time testing and iterating"], "Things to avoid at beta", "dont") %>

### At live

Things to consider:

- continuing performance data monitoring of drop out points


## Profession specific guidance

Each DDaT profession in DfE has their own community and guidance.
