Build a service that's simple to use so that people can succeed first time. Test it with users to make sure it works for them.

## Why it's important 

<%= example_panel("Assurance","<p>You’ll be assessed on what you’ve done to meet this Service Standard point at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>.</p>")%>


People expect services to work. They need things to be easy when they are trying to complete a task or find information. As a public sector organisation we have a legal duty to consider everyone's needs when designing and delivering services.  

## How to meet this standard at each phase

It's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed.

### At discovery

Assessors will look for:

- evidence of how policy decisions can be implemented in a user-centred way
- use of plain English and language that users understand
- an understanding of the types of users and scenarios relevant to the service
- whether existing technologies, components and patterns are being considered

<%= do_dont_list(["designing solutions without understanding user needs"], "Things to avoid", "dont") %>

### At alpha

Assessors will look for:

- the user journey being simple to use and understand, and based on research
- risks associated with the service have been mitigated through design
- a consistent user experience with other DfE services
- the route users take to the service has been considered
- offline elements, including <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2011/07/28/an-introduction-to-assisted-digital/" target="_blank">assisted digital (opens in new tab)</a> routes, have been considered
- a user-centred approach has been taken
- technology decisions supporting accessible and usable design
- content being tested to make sure that users understand it
- <a href="https://design.education.gov.uk/prototyping" target="_blank">prototypes (opens in new tab)</a> built and tested with users identified in discovery

<%= do_dont_list(["custom components and patterns being created and not shared or tested",
"dead ends in the journey or a disconnect between online and offline actions",
"where the service starts and ends not being clear",
"the service not achieving the users' goal"], "Things to avoid", "dont") %>


### At beta 

Assessors will look for:

- how data has been used to understand service performance and a plan for how you'll use this in live
- evidence of continuous improvement to make changes to the user journey or content
- evidence of usability testing, including users with the lowest level of digital skills
- how the service meets [accessibility](/accessibility/laws-and-standards.html) requirements

<%= do_dont_list(["not having a plan to continually improve the service",
"not understanding how user needs might change over time 
"], "Things to avoid", "dont") %>

### At live 

Assessors will look for:

- continual monitoring of feedback and testing usability
- user research to understand any performance issue

<%= do_dont_list(["not having a plan to continually improve the service",
"not understanding how user needs might change over time 
"], "Things to avoid", "dont") %>

## Profession specific guidance

Each DDaT profession in DfE has their own community and guidance.
