#6. Have a multidisciplinary team
<%= banner_panel("You'll be assessed on this","You'll be assessed on what you've done to meet this Service Standard point at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>.")%>

This guidance will help you apply  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-6-have-a-multidisciplinary-team" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">Service Standard point 6 (opens in new tab)</a>. 

Make sure you have a diverse mix of the skills and roles needed to build and operate the service.

Make as many decisions as possible in the team, so that you can respond quickly to what you learn about users and their needs.

## Why it's important

A team with a range of expertise and perspectives is more likely to come up with the best solution. The size and roles you'll need may change as you build the service.

When writing your business case make sure you consider how much it would cost to build the service, especially if you need to contract specialist roles or involve a managed service. For example, a contract day rate can start at Â£600 a day.

## How to meet this standard at each phase

It's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed.

### At discovery

Assessors will look for:

- how you've considered what roles you need in the team
- if there are contractors, a plan for how knowledge will be shared
- identifying where additional roles may be needed and how to fill them

### At alpha

Assessors will look for:

- if there is a person on the team who's responsible for user research and usability tests
- having people with the skills to understand data and what metrics you need to measure in the service
- the team continues to identify where roles are needed and how to fill them
- a plan to transfer knowledge and skills from contractors to permanent staff
- product and delivery managers with the knowledge and power to make day-to-day decisions to improve the service

<%= do_dont_list(["having one team member covering multiple roles, as this introduces a single point of failure",
"decisions being made without understanding, or having evidence to support them"], "Things to avoid", "dont") %>

### At beta and live

Assessors will look for:

- how the team and ways of working can keep improving the service
- knowledge and skills from contractors have been transferred to permanent staff
- a plan for what team you'll need to operate and support the service once live

## How to apply this standard in your role

Each DDaT profession at DfE has their own community and guidance on how to apply standards.
