This guidance will help you apply  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-7-use-agile-ways-of-working" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">Service Standard point 7 (opens in new tab)</a>. 

Make sure that the team can deliver quickly and adapt to meet users' needs. 

Use  <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">agile principles (opens in new tab)</a> and tools and have processes in place that follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/governance-principles-for-agile-service-delivery" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">governance principles for service delivery (opens in new tab)</a>. 

##Why it's important

By getting your service in front of real users as soon as possible you can get insights on how they use it and iterate based on what you learn.

Working this way means you're not specifying everything up front before you've developed an understanding of what users need, you will reduce the risk of delivering the wrong thing.

##How to meet this standard through the agile lifecycle

It's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed.

Assessors will look for:

- team using agile ways of working, researching, learning and changing
- evidence of decision making with senior stakeholders that allow you to adapt and change
- how the team are working in an agile way, using agile tools and techniques and how they'll continue to do so when the service moves from discovery to alpha, beta then live
- evidence that governance is being managed with measurable goals 
- the team being flexibly resourced 

## How to apply this standard in your role

Each DDaT profession at DfE has their own community and guidance on how to apply standards.
