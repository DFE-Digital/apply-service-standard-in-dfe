Make sure that the team can deliver quickly and adapt to meet users' needs. 

Use  <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">agile principles (opens in new tab)</a> and tools and have processes in place that follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/governance-principles-for-agile-service-delivery" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">governance principles for service delivery (opens in new tab)</a>. 

## Why it's important 

<%= example_panel("Assurance","<p>You’ll be assessed on what you’ve done to meet this Service Standard point at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>.</p>")%>


By getting your service in front of real users as soon as possible you can get insights on how they use it and iterate based on what you learn.

Working this way means you're not specifying everything up front before you've developed an understanding of what users need, you will reduce the risk of delivering the wrong thing.

##How to meet this standard through the delivery lifecycle

It's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed.

Assessors will look for:

- how the team use agile ways of working, tools and techniques 
- changes to the service are based on user research feedback and testing
- evidence of decision making with senior stakeholders that allow the team to adapt and change
- evidence that governance is being managed with measurable goals 
- the team has all the skills it needs at each phase of the agile lifecycle
