#9. Create a secure service which protects users' privacy

<%= banner_panel("You'll be assessed on this","You'll be assessed on what you've done to meet this Service Standard point at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>.")%>

Understand what data and information your service will be collecting, storing and providing.

Identify and address security threats, legal responsibilities, confidentiality and privacy issues and risks associated with the service. Consult experts where you need to.

## Why it's important

DfE handles personal and sensitive information about users. We have a legal duty to protect this information. Failing to do so would undermine public trust in DfE services.

## How to meet this standard at each phase

It's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed.

### At discovery

Assessors will look for:

- a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) has been started, where neccessary
- a plan that highlights headline General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements

### At alpha

Assessors will look for:

- a first iteration of a DPIA, where relevant
- demonstration that the service you want to build is technically possible and security compliant
- a plan for findings from checking technical feasibility and security compliance are addressed in beta

### At beta

Assessors will look for:

- evidence of addressing findings from alpha
- mitigation and risks around security have been raised and assigned
- findings of DPIA are being addressed

### At live

Assessors will look for:

- evidence of all risks to security have been addressed
- evidence of DPIA findings have been addressed


## Profession specific guidance

Each DDaT profession at DfE has their own community and guidance.
