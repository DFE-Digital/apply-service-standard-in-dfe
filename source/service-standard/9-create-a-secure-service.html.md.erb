Understand what data and information your service will be collecting from users, and how this will be stored and used.

Identify and address security threats, legal responsibilities, confidentiality, privacy issues and risks associated with the service. Consult experts where you need to.

## Why it's important 

DfE handles personal and sensitive information about users. We have a legal duty to protect this information. Failing to do so would undermine public trust in DfE services.



## How to meet this standard at each phase
You'll be assessed on what you've done to meet this standard at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>. However, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed, it's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard point.

<%= example_panel("DfE assessor tips","<p><b>Prompts to help services and products meet this standard </b><p>
<p>Does the service need identity assurance or authentication? If so, what is your approach to identifying and evaluating assurance and authentication methods that balances risks in a proportionate way? For example, using <a href='https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/common-components/#service-components-products-and-platforms target='_blank'>common components (opens in new tab)</a> , such as <a href='https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/common-components/#dfe-sign-in target='_blank'>DfE Sign-in (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>
<p>How will you manage and own risks through risk registers and information security officers (ISOs)?</p>")%>

### At discovery

#### Things to consider:

- evidence that a <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvewp00158/SitePages/DPIA.aspx" target="_blank">Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) (opens intranet page in new tab)</a> has been started, where necessary. If you do not have access to the DfE intranet, ask a colleague with access to get the information for you
- a plan that details headline General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements
- identify the minimum <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/collecting-personal-information-from-users" target="_blank">personal information (opens in new tab)</a> you need from users to provide the service 

### At alpha

#### Things to consider:

- continue to work on the DPIA, where relevant
- demonstrable evidence that the service you want to build is technically feasible and meets required security standards
- if delivery and security are two competing risks, speak to your Senior Responsible Officer (SRO) to discuss impact and requirement
- explore security anti-personas or bad actors for the service, if relevant
- a plan for how the findings from checking technical feasibility and security compliance will be addressed in beta
- how to protect users and the  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/protecting-your-service-against-fraud" target="_blank">service from fraud (opens in new tab)</a>

### At beta and live

#### Things to consider:

- evidence of addressing findings from alpha
- findings of DPIA are being addressed
- residual risks and mitigations security have been raised and assigned
- demonstrable evidence of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/securing-your-information" target="_blank">how services and data storage will be secured (opens in new tab)</a> to prevent data loss
- how you've tested your service to ensure it doesn't expose security risk, for example, testing against <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">OWASP Top 10 (opens in new tab)</a>
- use of common components, such as <a href="https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/common-components/#dfe-sign-in" target="_blank">DfE Sign-in</a> if authentification is required, to secure your service
- evidence that all risks to security have been addressed, when moving from beta to live



## Profession specific guidance

Each DDaT profession in DfE has their own community and guidance.
