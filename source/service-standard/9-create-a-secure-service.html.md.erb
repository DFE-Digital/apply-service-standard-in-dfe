Understand what data and information your service will be collecting from users, and how this will be stored and used.

Identify and address security threats, legal responsibilities, confidentiality, privacy issues and risks associated with the service. Consult experts where you need to.

## Why it's important 


<div class="govuk-warning-text">
  <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
  <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
    <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
	DfE handles personal and sensitive information about users. We have a legal duty to protect this information. Failing to do so would undermine public trust in DfE services.

## How to meet this standard at each phase
You'll be assessed on what you've done to meet this standard at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>. However, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed, it's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard point.

<%= example_panel("Think about","<p><b>Prompts from DfE assessors to help services and products meet this standard </b></p>
<p>How might the service meet security requirements and regulations without putting delivery at risk? Identifying key stakeholders and working with senior information risk owners (SIROs), information asset owners (IAOs) and data guardians can help with this.</p>
<p>Does the service need identity assurance or authentication? If so, what is your approach to identifying and evaluating assurance and authentication methods that balances risks in a proportionate way? For example, using common components, such as <a href='https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/common-components/#dfe-sign-in' target='_blank'>DfE Sign-in (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>
<p>What is the most appropriate way of securing your service and users information?</p>
<p>How you manage and own risks through risk registers and information security officers (ISOs).</p>")%>

### At discovery

Things to consider:

- evidence that <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvewp00158/SitePages/DPIA.aspx" target="_blank">Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) (opens intranet page in new tab)</a> has been started, where neccessary. If you do not have access to the DfE intranet, ask a civil servant to get the information for you
- a plan that details headline General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements
- identify the minimum <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/collecting-personal-information-from-users" target="_blank">personal information (opens in new tab)</a> you need from users to provide the service 

### At alpha

Things to consider:

- continued work on the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), where relevant
- demonstrable evidence that the service you want to build is technically feasible and meets required security standards
- exploring security anti-personas, if relevant
- a plan for findings from checking technical feasibility and security compliance are addressed in beta
- how to protect users and the  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/protecting-your-service-against-fraud" target="_blank">service from fraud (opens in new tab)</a>

### At beta and live

Things to consider:

- evidence of addressing findings from alpha
- findings of DPIA are being addressed
- residual risks and mitigations security have been raised and assigned
- demonstrable evidence of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/securing-your-information" target="_blank">how services and data storage will be secured (opens in new tab)</a> to prevent data loss
- how you've tested your service to ensure it doesn't expose security risk, for example, testing against <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">OWASP Top 10 (opens in new tab)</a>
- use of common components, such as <a href="https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/common-components/#dfe-sign-in" target="_blank">DfE Sign-in</a> if authentification is required, to secure your service
- evidence that all risks to security have been addressed, when moving from beta to live
