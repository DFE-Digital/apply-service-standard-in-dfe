#9. Create a secure service which protects users' privacy

<%= banner_panel("You'll be assessed on this","You'll be assessed on what you've done to meet this Service Standard point at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>.")%>

Evaluate what data and information your service will be collecting, storing and providing.

Identify and address security threats, legal responsibilities, confidentiality and privacy issues and risks associated with the service. Consult experts where you need to.

## Why it's important

DfE handles personal and sensitive information about users. We have a legal duty to protect this information. Failing to do so would undermine public trust in DfE services.

## How to meet this standard at each phase

It's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed.
